Network Protocols

Definition: The rules for successful communication between two parties

Rules:
1. Only one talks at the time
2. A response is expected
3. specific messages expect specific responses 

For example a mac and a web server:
	1. mac asks if it has permission to connect
	2. servers responds yes (or no)
	3. mac requests GET file name.org/index.php
	4. server sends file
For this to be successful, both the mac and the server needs to follow the same protocol.

These rules depend on the format and order of protocols. Following the same dialog, the mac cannot ask for a file before it asks for permission

Given an URL such as http://www.web.org/index.php, 
	http(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is a protocol and the foundation of communication for the World Wide Web.
	www.web.org is the server name
	index.php is the file name on the server. 
So the logic goes like this: Ask for the index.php file from the www.web.org server using the http protocol
