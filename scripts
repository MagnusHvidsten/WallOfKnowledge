Shell scripts

Definition: a file(usually a text editor containing ASCII text) containing a series of commands. The shell reads this file and carries out the commands as if it was entered directly into the command line. 

Three basic steps:
1. write the script
	use nano or some other text editor 
2. Give shell permission to execute it
	chmod 755 filename (755 gives me read write and execute permissions, others can only read and execute. 700 gives private)
3. put it somewhere shell can find it
