Shell scripts

Definition: a file(usually a text editor containing ASCII text) containing a series of commands. The shell reads this file and carries out the commands as if it was entered directly into the command line. 

Three basic steps:
1. write the script
2. Give shell permission to execute it
3. put it somewhere shell can find it
