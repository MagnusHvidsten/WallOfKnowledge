Types of bugs:
	- Crash bug
	- Memory: memory use or memory leak bug
	- CPU: bug about slowness or high CPU usage
	- Hang
	- arithmetic bugs
		- Division by zero
		- arithmetic overflow or underflow: value is too large for a register or storage location can store or represent
		- loss of precision because of rounding or numerically unstable algorithms
	- logical bugs
		- infinite loop or infinite recursion
		- off-by-one error, counting one to many or one to few when looping
	- syntax error
		- using = instead or == or using ++i instead of i++
	- resource bugs
		- null pointer dereference 
		- using an unitialized variable
		- using an otherwise valid operation on an wrong data type
		- access violations
		- resource leaks; when a finite system resource such as memory or file handles become exhausted by repeated allocation without release
		- buffer overflow; when a program tries to store data beyond it's allocated storage. May lead to access violation or storage violation, and are a source of security vulnerability
		- excessive recustion though logically valid causes stack overflow. 
		- Use-after-free where a pointer is used after the system has freed the memory it references. 
		- double free, when free() is called more than once on the same memory address
	- Multi-threading programming bugs
		- Deadlock; when A can continue until B is done, but B can continue until A is done. 
	 	- Race condition; When a program does not execute instructions in the order the programmer intended to. 
	 	- concurrency errors; shared resources
	- Interfacing bugs
	 	- Incorrect API usage.
	 	- Incorrect protocol implementation.
	 	- Incorrect hardware handling.
	 	- Incorrect assumptions of a particular platform.
	 	- incompatible systems; backwards or forwards compatibillity problems. 
	- Preformance bugs
		- too high computational complexity of algorithm
		- Random disk access or memory access
	- Teamworking bugs
		- Unpropogated updates; changing myAdd function but forgets to change mySubtract which uses the same algorithm
		- out of date comments which no longer hold true
		- difference between documentation and actual product.
